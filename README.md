# Overview

Welcome to my Food Truck Project. This project simulates a small food truck
creation program. It allows a user to create up to five food trucks and assign
them each with a name, food type, and a rating. The user can then access this
information displayed in different formats using a menu until the 'quit' option
is selected.

### How To Run

This program is a simple java program. As such you are able to run it by opening
the MakeChange.class file in an IDE or terminal and run using the appropriate
commands.

### Technologies Used

 - Abstraction
 - Encapsulation
 - Loops
 - If else statements
 - Switch statements
 - Input validation
 - Overriding built in methods
 - Field initialization blocks

### Lessons Learned

I had a great time with this project. In this project I intentionally focused on
beginning to implement my lessons on encapsulation by wrapping class data inside
of a protective fence. All class fields are private and only manipulated using
setters and getters. There are loops, if-else statements and a switch statement
used for various things such as menu choices and input validation. Additionally,
I gained a keener understanding of the importance of understanding and recogniz-
ing the different uses and needs for class instance fields and static class
fields. I was also able to learn how using a field initialization block can
connect static fields to instance fields in a very powerful way. Overall I am
excited at how powerful my progress. I'm beginning to see the flexibility (and
complexity!) that Object Oriented Programming offers. It is almost like it is
using programming to model the real world.
